            <p>I. What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, 
            which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br>
            II. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your 
            spirit, which are God’s.</p>

            <p>I. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.<br>
            II. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.<br>
            III. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</p>

            <p>I. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial
            is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.<br>
            II. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory
            of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.<br>
            III. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised
            in incorruption:</p>

            faith,<br>
            II. Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>

            II. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
            the body of Christ:<br>
            III. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
            unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:<br>
            IV. That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with
            every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie
            in wait to deceive;</p>

            gathering together unto him,<br>
            II. That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word,
            nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.<br>
            III. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come
            a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</p>

            II. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
            for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
            III. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
