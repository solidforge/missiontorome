            <p class="indented">As I did this project, I realized that Paul gave a lot of insight into the
            calling and work that the Prophet and apostles have to do. One incredible thing about Paul that
            I love is that when he heard of a problem that was happening in the church, he immediately
            addressed it by sending a letter to the people in that "church", which in our day is equivalent
            to stakes, wards, or missions. It's incredible that with a single epistle he was able to calm down
            the people that he was writing to. He was ready to receive revelation for other congregations
            even when he had not seen them for extended periods of time.</p>
            <p class="indented">Thanks to Paul, the Christian church has spread throughout the whole world. If we travel to
            different countries in Europe and the Holy Land we will find many Christian people. That influence
            spread to both North and South America, and today approximately 31% of the world population are
            Christian. The early church that Paul led served as a model for our church in the latter days by 
            showing church organization, demonstrating Christlike teaching, and setting forth methods for
            missionary work that are practiced by missionaries all across the world today.</p><br />
