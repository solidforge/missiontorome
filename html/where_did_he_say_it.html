                </div>
                <h3>Tarsus</h3>
                <p>Capital of Cilicia, Paul’s city (Acts 9:11, 30; 11:25; 21:39; 22:3). It was a place
                of considerable importance (Paul calls it “no mean city”), containing a university
                celebrated for its school of philosophy and literature. It was situated on an important
                highway leading from Antioch, through the Cilician Gates (a pass in the Taurus mountains),
                toward the cities of the Roman province of Asia.</p>

                    <h4>Corinth</h4>
                </div>
                <h3>Corinth</h3>
                <p>While Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he was writing from Corinth.</p>
                <p>Chief town of the Roman province of Achaia. It had a magnificent situation on the
                isthmus connecting the Peloponnesus with the mainland of Greece, possessing a harbor
                on both eastern and western sides. It was practically destroyed at the Roman conquest,
                146 B.C., but was rebuilt by Julius Caesar a hundred years later. Paul lived here for a
                year and six months (Acts 18:1–18) in the course of his second missionary journey. Soon
                after his departure it was visited by Apollos. We learn from the two epistles to the
                Corinthians that the Church here was split up into parties and that the Judaizing element
                was very active. Near here were held the famous Isthmian games, from which Paul borrows
                the striking imagery of 1 Cor. 9:24–27.</p>
                <p>Corinth was the meeting point of many nationalities because the main current of the trade
                between Asia and western Europe passed through its harbors. Paul’s first visit lasted
                nearly two years; his converts were mainly Greeks, gifted with a keen sense of the joys of physical
                existence, a passion for freedom, and a genius for rhetoric and logic, but reared in the midst of
                the grossest moral corruption, undisciplined and self-conceited.</p>
                <p>[The Epistle to the Romans] was written from Corinth toward the end of the stay recorded in Acts 20:3.
                Paul was then contemplating a visit to Jerusalem, which was certain to be dangerous
                (Rom. 15:31). If he escaped with his life he hoped afterwards to visit Rome. The letter
                was meant in part to prepare the Church there to receive him when he came. It may also
                be regarded as containing a statement of doctrines that had been in dispute with the
                Judaizing Christians and that Paul now regarded as finally established.</p>

                    <h4>Macedonia</h4>
                </div>
                <h3>Macedonia</h3>
                <p>The epistle was written by him (probably while traveling through Macedonia) at the news
                of a wholesale defection from the truth of the gospel in favor of a return to the bondage of
                the Jewish law. In the epistle he vindicates his own position as an Apostle, enunciates the
                doctrine of righteousness by faith, and affirms the value of spiritual religion as opposed to
                a religion of externals.</p>
                <p>The region that lay north of Achaia and south of what are now called the Balkan Mountains.
                It was the first part of Europe in which Paul preached the gospel (Acts 16:9–10) and
                contained many well-known places, such as Neapolis, Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea.
                Macedonia and Thessaly together constituted a Roman Province under the government of a
                proconsul, who lived at Thessalonica.</p>
            </div>
                
            <h2>Epistle to the Philippians</h2>
            <div class="container">

                <div class="text-block" style="top: 30px; left: 530px;">
                    <h4>Philippi</h4>
                </div>
                <h3>Philippi</h3>
                <p>The church at Philippi was the earliest founded by Paul in Europe (Acts 16:11–40).
                His first visit ended abruptly, but he was not forgotten, and his converts sent him
                supplies not only while he remained in the neighborhood, but also after he had moved
                on to Corinth (Philip. 4:15–16). He passed through Philippi six years later (Acts 20:2)
                on his way from Ephesus to Corinth, and again on his return (Acts 20:6) from Corinth to
                Jerusalem. When the news of his removal to Rome reached the Philippians, they sent one
                of their number, Epaphroditus (Philip. 2:25), to minister to him in their name. The
                strain of work in the capital proved too severe, and Epaphroditus had to be sent home
                (2:26–30), taking with him the epistle to the Philippians. Its main purpose is to express
                Paul’s gratitude and affection, and to cheer them under the disappointment of his protracted
                imprisonment.</p>
                <p>A city of Macedonia, founded by Philip, father of Alexander the Great; visited by Paul
                (Acts 16:12–40; 20:6; see also Philip. 1:1; 1 Thes. 2:2). It is described as a Roman
                “colony”; it contained a body of Roman citizens, placed there for military purposes,
                governed directly from Rome and independent of provincial governors and local magistrates.
                The church there was mainly gentile, there being no Jewish synagogue. Paul’s visit was
                memorable for his assertion of his rights as a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37). The converts
                were afterwards generous in their contributions toward his support (Philip. 4:15).</p>

            <h2>Epistle to the Colossians / Ephesians / Philemon</h2>

                    <h4>Rome</h4>
                </div>
                <h3>From Prison in Rome</h3>
                <p>[Colossians] was the result of a visit from Epaphras, the evangelist of the Church
                in Colosse (1:7–8), who reported that the Colossians were falling into serious error,
                the result of a deep consciousness of sin leading to a desire to attain moral
                perfection by mechanical means, the careful observance of external ordinances
                (2:16) and ascetic restrictions (2:20), coupled with special devotion to a host
                of angelic mediators. The attractiveness of such teaching was due not only to the
                satisfaction it offered to the craving after sanctification, but also to the show
                it made of superior wisdom and greater insight into the mysteries of the universe.
                Paul shows that Christ, in His own person, is the one principle of the unity of the
                universe, and that sanctification is to be found only through union with Him.</p>
                <p>[Ephesians] was carried by the same messenger who bore the Colossians’ letter.
                The epistle is of great importance, for it contains Paul’s teaching regarding the
                Church of Christ.</p>
                <p>[Philemon] is a private letter about Onesimus, a slave who had robbed his
                master, Philemon, and run away to Rome. Paul sent him back to his master at
                Colosse in company with Tychicus the bearer of the epistle to the Colossians.
                Paul asks that Onesimus be forgiven and received back as a fellow Christian.</p>
