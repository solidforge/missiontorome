            <h1 style="text-align: center;">An Introduction to Paul</h1>
            <p class="indented">The life and work of the great Apostle Paul is recorded at considerable length in the Acts
                and the epistles.<br><br> It is only possible to indicate here a few of the chief facts.<br><br> He was 
                known in early life as Saul; his Latin name Paul is first mentioned at the beginning of
                his gentile ministry (Acts 13:9).<br><br> He belonged to Tarsus, in Cilicia (Acts 9:11); was a
                Pharisee and a pupil of Gamaliel (Acts 22:3); was active in the persecution of Christians
                (Acts 8:3; 26:10; Gal. 1:13; Philip. 3:6); and took part in the martyrdom of Stephen
                (Acts 7:58; 8:1).<br><br> He started for Damascus for the purpose of further persecution
                (Acts 9:1) and on the road saw a vision of the Lord Jesus, which changed the whole
                current of his life (Acts 9:4–19; 22:7; 26:14; Gal. 1:15–16).<br><br> After his baptism by
                Ananias (Acts 9:18), he retired into Arabia (Gal. 1:17) and then returned to Damascus,
                where he preached (Acts 9:19–25; 2 Cor. 11:32; Gal. 1:17–18).<br><br> Being compelled to flee,
                out three years after his conversion he went to Jerusalem, where he stayed 15 days, Barnabas
                introducing him to Peter and James (Acts 9:26–30; Gal. 1:18–19).<br><br> Being in danger, he retired
                to Tarsus (Acts 9:29–30) and there remained six or seven years, preaching in Syria and Cilicia
                (Gal. 1:21–24).<br><br> He was then brought by Barnabas to Antioch (Acts 11:26) and after one year paid
                a visit to Jerusalem (Acts 11:29–30).<br><br> After two more years’ work in Antioch, he started with
                Barnabas and Mark on his first missionary journey (Acts 13:1–14:26).<br><br> Then came another visit to
                Jerusalem with Barnabas to attend a conference with the other Apostles (Acts 15:1–33; Gal. 2:1–10),
                after which they returned to Antioch (Acts 15:35).<br><br> He then started on his second missionary journey
                (Acts 15:36–18:22), which lasted about three years and ended with a visit to Jerusalem.<br><br> After a 
                short stay in Antioch, Paul began his third journey, which occupied about 3½ years (Acts 18:23–21:15). 
                On his return to Jerusalem he was arrested and sent to Caesarea (Acts 21:17–23:35), where he remained
                a prisoner for two years (Acts 24:1–26:32), and was then sent for trial to Rome, suffering shipwreck
                on the way (Acts 27:1–28:10).<br><br> He remained in Rome two years (Acts 28:30) and was then released.<br><br> He
                then appears to have visited Asia, Macedonia, Crete, and perhaps Spain. At the end of about four
                years he was again taken a prisoner to Rome and suffered martyrdom, probably in the spring of A.D.
                65.<br><br> For an account of his teaching, see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/pauline-epistles?lang=eng">
